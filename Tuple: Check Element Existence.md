# Tuple in Python: Check Element Existence

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that checks if the element `'n'` and the element `8` exist within a given tuple.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Define a tuple `x` with some letters and numbers.
2. Use the `in` operator to check if the string `'n'` exists within the tuple.
3. Use the `in` operator to check if the integer `8` exists within the tuple.
4. Print the results.

## 🧾 Program
```python
x = ('a', 'b', 'c', 'n', 1, 2, 8, 10)

if 'n' in x:
    print("'n' is present in the tuple.")
else:
    print("'n' is not present in the tuple.")

if 8 in x:
    print("8 is present in the tuple.")
else:
    print("8 is not present in the tuple.")
```
